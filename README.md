# giphy-page
I made an array of actions and made buttons for each one. When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page. 
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing. 
You can add a new animal from the form on the right side of the page. 
The animal will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button
